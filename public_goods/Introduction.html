    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In this game with {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP}} players,
        each player starts with an endowment of {{C.ENDOWMENT}}.
        You must decide whether to keep the money for yourself or contribute it to a common pool.
        The efficiency factor of {{C.EFFICIENCY}} means that for every point contributed to the common pool,
        it generates {{C.EFFICIENCY}} units of benefit to all players.
        The challenge is to balance individual gains with maximizing
        the overall benefit for everyone.
